8/18/20, 10:03 AM - Ansh: Ok so on August 28 apple will terminate all epic developer accounts and cut of epic from iOS and Mac development tools that means basically even if they wanted to update *ANYTHING* running on unreal engine they cant.

Any apple developer tools won't be available for all apple platforms for unreal engine so no game running on the unreal engine like P**G can update till the lawsuit settles

With that fortnite is permanently banned from the app store and glitch kings method to updat doesn't work anymore
